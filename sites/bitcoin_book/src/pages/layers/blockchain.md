## The blockchain

When you initiate transactions, they are not effective immediately.
A transaction becomes effective by being written on the *blockchain*,
or more specifically: by being included in a *block*.

Each block contains a bunch of transactions that people and machines initiated across the network.
Each block also points to the last block before it, forming a chain... ***the blockchain***.

The links of the blockchain are very strong - cryptographically strong!
How exactly this works and how new blocks come into existence (how they are "*mined*") - we'll talk about that [later](todo).
