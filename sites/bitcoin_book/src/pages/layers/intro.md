There are many resources online that give an introduction into how Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems work under the hood.
Each has its own unique perspective and focus.
Our approach here is to look at it all in terms of *layers*.
We also simulate a miniature blockchain network for you - in your browser, right now!
It is a close enough model of Bitcoin, and you are invited to interact with it!

This page here shows you all layers at once.
This is a lot of information!
Try exploring one layer at a time.
By clicking on a layer name (the labels with a **+**) you can open some explanatory text about that layer.
Also try clicking or hovering around the visual elements - many of them are interactive!
You can control the speed of the simulation via the time controls way below.
