## Wallets

*Wallets* form the top layer of our hierarchy and are usually the only thing that regular users get to see.
The interface of your real-life wallet will likely differ!
But the main idea is the same: You can send `coins` to your friends and business contacts.
Try it!

The `coins` here are not real, don't worry!
