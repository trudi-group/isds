Applications, typically in the form of *wallets*,
form the top layer of our view and are usually the only thing that regular users get to see.
The interface of your real-life wallet will likely differ from what we are showing you here!
But the main idea is the same: You can send `coins` to your friends and business contacts.
Try it!

The `coins` here are not real, don't worry!
And if you wonder who `Roberts` and `CoinBroker25` are:
These are just some random addresses from which `Alice` has received `coins` in the
(not so distant) past. So she has `coins` to spend now <i class="fas fa-smile-wink"></i>
