Consensus is the process by which the network decides which chain of blocks is going to be the "correct" blockchain.
Consensus in Bitcoin is characterized by two central features:

- Use of [Proof-of-Work](consensus/pow) (an extremely intense game of dice) for determining who will get to propose (or *mine*) the next block.
- Use of the *longest chain rule* for determining, in the case of *forks*, which blockchain is the "correct" one.

The specifics are a bit complex - we hide them behind a magic button here!
Click it to cause a random node to "win the lottery" and mine a block.

Or just wait for ~10 minutes of simulated time - this is the average *block interval* in Bitcoin,
the average time it takes for the network to mine a block.
